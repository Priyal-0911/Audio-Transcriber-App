# 🎤 Audio Transcriber App

Welcome to the Audio Transcriber App! This is your one-stop solution for converting your audio files into text. Powered by the magic of OpenAI's Whisper model and the simplicity of Streamlit, this app ensures that your words are never lost, just transformed.

## 📜 What Does It Do?

The Whisper Transcriber App takes in audio files in `.mp3` or `.wav` format and converts them into text. It's like having a personal scribe, but cooler and less demanding. 

## 💡 How to Use It?

1. **Upload an Audio File**: Click on the file uploader and choose your `.mp3` or `.wav` file.
2. **Watch the Magic**: The app will transcribe your audio into text using the powerful model.
3. **Read Your Transcription**: Voila! Your audio is now in text form, ready to be read and appreciated.

🛠️ Code Breakdown
Here's a quick rundown of what's happening under the hood:

Import Libraries: We import the necessary libraries like Streamlit, Whisper, and PyTorch.
Device Check: We check if a GPU is available for faster processing. If not, we use the CPU.
Streamlit App Setup: We set up the title and file uploader in Streamlit.
File Handling: We handle the uploaded audio file and save it temporarily.
Transcription: The Whisper model transcribes the audio file.
Display Transcription: The transcribed text is displayed on the app.
🤖 How Whisper Works
The Whisper model is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It's capable of understanding a variety of accents, dialects, and languages. You can read more about it on the OpenAI GitHub.

😂 Fun Fact
Did you know that the Whisper model is so good at understanding audio that it once transcribed a parrot's chirping into "Polly wants a cracker"? Okay, maybe not, but it's still pretty impressive!
